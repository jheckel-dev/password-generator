# password-generator
 
 This is my 3rd homework assignment for my coding bootcamp program.

I have been assigned to create a random password generator that creates multicharacter paswords ranging from no less than 8 and no more than 128 characters. 

These characters must include upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 

I have been provided the complete code for the HTML and CSS so I get to focus on writing the generator using Java Script.
